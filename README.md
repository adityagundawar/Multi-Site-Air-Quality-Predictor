This report investigates the use of the LSTM recurrent neural network (RNN) as a framework for forecasting in the future the pollution level, based on time series data of pollution and meteorological information in Beijing as per the UCI Machine Learning Repository. Due to the sequence dependencies associated with large-scale and longer time series datasets, RNNs, and in particular LSTM models, are well-suited. Our results show that the LSTM framework produces equivalent accuracy when predicting future time steps.
